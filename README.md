## Features

- 🎙️ Global hotkey recording — hold-to-record or toggle mode
- 💊 Floating capsule widget that stays on top
- 🗣️ 7+ STT providers: Deepgram, AssemblyAI, Gemini 3.5 Transcribe, Whisper, Groq, GLM-ASR, SiliconFlow
- 🤖 Text polishing via multiple LLMs: OpenAI, DeepSeek, Claude, Gemini, Ollama, and more
- A compact, text-free capsule: an audio-reactive waveform while recording, then processing dots until the result is pasted. Hover or focus to cancel.
- ⌨️ Lands in whatever app is focused, via the clipboard plus a synthesized ⌘V / Ctrl+V — split into chunks for terminal CLIs that choke on bulk pastes
- ✏️ Edit selected text by voice — select a paragraph, say "fix the grammar" or "make this shorter", and the selection is rewritten in place (macOS only, requires AI Polish; works in native apps and browser text fields, not in Monaco-based editors like VS Code or Cursor)
- 🌐 Translation mode: speak in one language, output in another (20+ languages)
- 📖 Custom dictionary for domain-specific terms
- 🔍 Per-app detection to adapt formatting
- 📜 Local history with full-text search — optional, with automatic cleanup after 7/30/90 days
- 🌗 Dark / light / system theme
- 🚀 Auto-start on login

> [!TIP]
> **Recommended Configuration for Best Experience**

## Download

Download the latest version for your platform:

**[Download from Releases](https://github.com/azhurb/opentypeless/releases)**

| Platform | File |
|----------|------|
| Windows | `.msi` installer |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `.dmg` |
| macOS (Intel) | `.dmg` |
| Linux | `.AppImage` / `.deb` |

## Installation

### macOS

Builds are signed with a self-signed certificate (not a paid Apple Developer ID), so macOS quarantines them on download. On first install, strip the quarantine attribute:

1. Open the `.dmg` and drag **Pipeup** into `/Applications`.
2. In Terminal, run:
   ```bash
   xattr -cr /Applications/Pipeup.app
   ```
3. Launch the app. Grant **Microphone** and **Accessibility** permissions when prompted.

When upgrading to a new release, repeat step 2 (each download gets a fresh quarantine flag).

**Upgrading from OpenTypeless:** turn off Launch at Startup in the old app if enabled, then quit it. After installing Pipeup, move the old `OpenTypeless.app` to Trash so both copies cannot start. Re-enable Launch at Startup from Pipeup if you use it. Keep the application data: Pipeup retains `com.opentypeless.app`, the existing credential namespace, settings, history, and dictionary. Grant permissions if macOS requests them. The repository URL remains unchanged during this rebrand.

### Windows and Linux

Open the installer / AppImage / `.deb` and follow the standard install prompts.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20+
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (stable toolchain)
- Platform-specific dependencies for Tauri: see [Tauri Prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm run tauri dev

# Build for production
npm run tauri build
```

The built application will be in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

## Configuration

All settings are accessible from the in-app Settings panel:

- **Speech Recognition** — choose STT provider and enter your API key
- **AI Polish** — choose LLM provider, model, and API key
- **General** — hotkey, theme, auto-start
- **Dictionary** — add custom terms for better transcription accuracy

API keys are never kept in a plaintext settings file. On Windows they go to Credential Manager and on Linux to the Secret Service; on macOS they go to a file only your account can read, because the Keychain would ask for your password after every app update unless the project pays for an Apple Developer ID. If you are upgrading from a version that kept them in `settings.json`, they move across on first launch. All STT/LLM requests go directly from your machine to the provider you configure. There is no cloud account, subscription, telemetry, or auto-update — this fork is BYOK-only.

**Data Flow Pipeline:**

```
Microphone → Audio Capture → STT Provider → Raw Transcript → LLM Polish → Clipboard Paste
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Plugin system for custom STT/LLM integrations
- [ ] Improved multi-language STT accuracy and dialect support
- [ ] Voice commands (e.g. "delete last sentence")
- [ ] Customizable hotkey combinations
- [ ] Improved onboarding experience
- [ ] Mobile companion app

## FAQ

**Is my audio sent to the cloud?**
Audio goes directly to whichever STT provider you configure (e.g., Groq, Deepgram). No data is routed through Pipeup servers — there is no telemetry or background reporting in this fork.

**Can I use it offline?**
With a local STT provider (Whisper via Ollama) and a local LLM (Ollama), the app works entirely offline. No internet connection needed.

**Which languages are supported?**
STT supports 99+ languages depending on the provider. AI polish and translation support 20+ target languages.

**Is the app free?**
Yes. Bring your own provider API keys.
