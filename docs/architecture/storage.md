# Storage

Pipeup uses local app data for config, history, dictionary, and window/onboarding state, plus platform-specific credential storage for provider API keys. See [Feature map](../domain/features.md) and [Pipeline](pipeline.md) for how stored values feed user-facing behavior.

Evidence: `src-tauri/src/storage/mod.rs`, `src-tauri/src/credentials.rs`, `src-tauri/migrations/001_init.sql`, `src/lib/tauri.ts`, `src/lib/credentials.ts`, `src/App.tsx`.

## Where secrets live

**API keys are never written to `settings.json`, and never sent to the webview.**

| Platform | Store | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | Credential Manager | user-scoped, no prompts |
| Linux | Secret Service, file fallback | unlocks with the login session |
| **macOS** | **`credentials.json`, `0600`** | the Keychain would prompt for a password after every app update - see [below](#macos-deliberately-does-not-use-the-keychain) |

The Config and SQLite sections describe non-secret settings and local content. The Credentials section describes API key persistence.

## Config (`tauri-plugin-store`)

- File: `settings.json` in the OS app-data directory.
- Keys in that file: `app_config` (Rust `storage::AppConfig`), `window_state`, `onboarding_completed` (set from the frontend).
- Manager: `ConfigManager` caches the deserialized config in memory and writes updates back to the store.
- `AppConfig` holds no secrets. It carries `stt_provider` / `llm_provider`, which are also the keys under which credentials are filed.

### `AppConfig` defaults

Verified against `src-tauri/src/storage/mod.rs::Default::default`:

| Field | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `stt_provider` | `glm-asr` |
| `stt_languages` | `[]` (empty = auto-detect) |
| `llm_provider` | `openrouter` |
| `llm_model` | `google/gemini-2.5-flash` |
| `polish_enabled` | `true` |
| `translate_enabled` | `false` |
| `target_lang` | `en` |
| `hotkey` | `Alt+Shift+/` (macOS) / `Ctrl+Shift+/` (other) |
| `hotkey_mode` | `hold` |
| `close_to_tray` | `true` |
| `max_recording_seconds` | `30` |
| `learn_from_corrections_enabled` | `false` |
| `history_enabled` | `true` |
| `history_retention_days` | `0` (= keep forever) |

If you add or change a default, update this table in the same PR.

### Config migrations

`ConfigManager::load` runs two migrations on the raw JSON value before deserializing into `AppConfig`. Both are idempotent, and a mutated value is written back on the same load.

- `migrate_legacy_config` - pre-multi-language installs persisted `stt_language: String` (with the sentinel `"multi"`). Converts `"multi"` / `""` to `stt_languages = []` and any other code to `[code]`, then removes the legacy key.
- `credentials::migrate_legacy_config_secrets` - moves plaintext `stt_api_key` / `llm_api_key` into the credential vault. Covered under [Credentials](#credentials-os-credential-vault).

Add new migrations to `migrate_legacy_config` rather than re-mapping fields downstream; tests live in `storage::config_migration_tests` and `credentials::tests`.

### Load failures fail open, loudly

If `app_config` cannot be deserialized, `ConfigManager::load` falls back to
`AppConfig::default()` - the app has to start. That fallback re-enables anything the user
opted out of, including `history_enabled`, and if the value also needed legacy migration the
defaults are then written back over their settings. It therefore logs at `error` with the
serde message. If you add another privacy-relevant flag, this is the fail-open path to think
about.

## Credentials (OS credential vault)

Provider API key storage is implemented in `src-tauri/src/credentials.rs`. macOS uses
an owner-only file; Windows and Linux use the `keyring` crate with a file fallback.
Legacy plaintext keys in `settings.json` are migrated as described below.

- **Service name**: `com.azhurb.pipeup` (matches the `tauri.conf.json` bundle identifier,
  so entries are attributable in Keychain Access / Credential Manager).
- **Account**: `<namespace>:<provider>` - `stt:deepgram`, `llm:openrouter`. Changing this
  format requires another credential migration. The one-time [identity import](identity-migration.md)
  copies readable keys from the old service name into this one.
- **Payload**: JSON `{ "version": 1, "secret": "…" }`. The version stamp is forward
  compatibility only; a bare (hand-written) secret is also accepted on read.

### Credentials are per provider

Keys are filed under `(namespace, provider)`, not per namespace. Switching STT provider and
switching back remembers the earlier key instead of overwriting it, and `siliconflow` - which
is both an STT and an LLM provider id - gets two independent slots.

### Keys are write-only from the webview's perspective

A secret travels one way: the user types it, `set_api_key` puts it in the vault, and nothing
ever hands it back. `AppConfig` has no key fields, the Zustand store has no key fields, and
`get_config` returns no secret. What the frontend can ask is *whether* a key exists, via
`get_credential_status(sttProvider, llmProvider)`, which returns a `KeyPresence` per
namespace rather than the secret.

Consequences worth knowing:

| Concern | How it works |
| --- | --- |
| Store unavailable | Falls back to an unencrypted `credentials.json`, reported as `saved_unencrypted` and shown as a warning. See [above](#the-credential-store-may-never-break-the-app). |
| Settings / onboarding input | The field is genuinely **empty** with a "saved" placeholder - not a masked value. `keyDrafts[ns] === null` means untouched, so the unsaved-changes bar cannot mistake a placeholder for an edit (the `0.5.0` bug in `CHANGELOG.md`). |
| Removing a key | "Remove" stages an empty-string draft; Save calls `set_api_key` with `""`, which deletes the entry. It is a pending change like any other setting, not an immediate side effect. |
| Testing a key | `test_*` / `bench_*` / `fetch_llm_models` take `api_key: Option<String>`. `Some(candidate)` probes an unsaved key - required by onboarding, where nothing is saved yet, and by Settings, where probing the stored key right after pasting a new one would report on the wrong credential. `None` means "use the vault". A candidate is never persisted as a side effect of testing. |
| `fetch_llm_models` | Gained a `provider` parameter, purely to name the vault entry to fall back on. |
| Onboarding gate | `should_show_window_on_launch` takes "the vault has no entry for the selected STT provider" instead of `stt_api_key.is_empty()`. An unreadable vault counts as no key, erring toward showing onboarding rather than starting hidden and broken. |
| Logging | `pipeline.rs` logs key **length** only. Never log the value. |

### Legacy plaintext migration

`migrate_legacy_config_secrets` runs inside `ConfigManager::load`. For each of
`stt_api_key` / `llm_api_key` it writes the secret to the vault under the currently selected
provider, then removes the plaintext field.

**The ordering is load-bearing: the plaintext is cleared only after the vault write returns
`Ok`.** A locked, unavailable, or denied vault leaves the config exactly as it was, so the
user keeps a working key and the migration retries next launch. Clearing first would destroy
the only copy of a secret the user may never have written down.

Because `AppConfig` no longer models those fields, serializing it would drop them - so a
launch with a locked vault followed by *any* Settings save would erase the key anyway.
`ConfigManager` therefore holds `pending_legacy_secrets`: whatever the migration could not
vault is re-attached by every `save` until a later launch succeeds.

Other cases: an empty legacy field is dropped without touching the vault; an existing vault
entry wins over stale plaintext (and the plaintext is dropped); a missing `*_provider` leaves
the plaintext in place, since there is nothing to file it under.

### macOS deliberately does not use the Keychain

A Keychain item carries a XARA **partition list** naming the code identities allowed to read
it. Entries are keyed by `teamid:` only when the app is signed with an Apple Developer ID;
without one macOS falls back to `cdhash:` - the hash of that exact binary.

This project signs with a self-signed certificate and has no Apple team, so every release is
a different identity to the partition list. Measured with two pipeline-signed builds that
share one certificate:

```
ACL partition mismatch: client cdhash:9fd54284…  ACL (cdhash:d1f9d146…)
asking user about XARA partition for 'cdhash:9fd54284…'
```

That is a keychain-password prompt for the user after **every app update**, which is worse
than what the app did before this change (a plaintext config file and no prompts). So
`credentials::default_store` uses [`FileVault`] on macOS: owner-only (`0600`), no prompts,
and still not the world-readable `settings.json` keys used to live in.

Note the same certificate is **not** enough - it is the Team ID that makes partition entries
stable. `certificate leaf = H"…"` in the designated requirement governs the *ACL*; the
partition list is a separate check and is what actually prompts here.

**This is reversible the day the project has an Apple Developer ID** ($99/yr): a Team ID makes
partition entries stable across versions, `default_store` should then use
`SystemCredentialVault` on macOS, and `FILE_STORE_IS_THE_DEFAULT` becomes `false`. Pinned by
`credentials::tests::macos_keeps_keys_out_of_the_keychain`.

### The credential store may never break the app

`FallbackVault` wraps the real vault and falls back to `FileVault` - a `0600`
JSON file at `<app_data_dir>/credentials.json` - when the store is genuinely
unavailable.

This is not optional polish. On Linux, `keyring`'s `linux-native-sync-persistent`
writes keyutils *and* Secret Service, and **reverts the keyutils write if the
Secret Service write fails** (verified in `keyring-3.6.3/src/keyutils_persistent.rs`).
On a minimal WM or headless box with no Secret Service provider, a fresh install
could not save an API key at all - the app would be unusable, which is strictly
worse than the plaintext config this change replaced.

On Windows and Linux, the OS credential store is preferred but must not prevent
the app from saving credentials. The following fallback rules apply on those platforms;
macOS uses the file directly.

- A key only reaches the file when the store **refuses the write**.
- **The contents are not encrypted**, so on Windows and Linux `get_credential_status` reports
  `saved_unencrypted` and both Settings panes show a visible warning. On macOS it is the
  intended store, so it reports plain `saved` - warning on every launch would cry wolf.
  Storing a secret in the clear silently would be worse than the old
  `settings.json`, because it would be invisible.
- If the store later starts working, the next save **promotes** the key into it
  and deletes the cleartext copy.
- `delete` always clears both, so a removed key cannot survive in the other.
- A read error with no fallback copy still surfaces as an error, never as
  "no key set".

### Reads are cached for the session

`CachingVault` wraps the real vault and remembers secrets it has already read,
so a session touches the OS credential store roughly twice instead of twice per
dictation (the pipeline resolves an STT key and an LLM key every time).

The cache originally reduced repeated macOS Keychain prompts. Current macOS builds
use the file store, so this history does not describe their normal permission flow.

Only successful reads are cached. Errors are not, so a locked keychain keeps
reporting itself instead of being remembered as a failure for the session;
misses are not, so a key added out of band is still picked up. `write` and
`delete` update the cache after the store accepts the change, never before.

### Legacy macOS Keychain prompts

Current macOS builds do not read provider keys from the Keychain. Older builds or
custom builds using `SystemCredentialVault` can prompt. The release signing certificate
is still named `OpenTypeless Release`, but Pipeup now has its own bundle identifier.
A stable designated requirement alone does not prevent partition-list prompts.
See [the macOS storage decision](#macos-deliberately-does-not-use-the-keychain) and
[Identity migration](identity-migration.md).

Windows and Linux have no equivalent per-app prompt: Credential Manager is
scoped to the user account, and Secret Service unlocks with the login session.
A Linux box with no Secret Service provider at all (minimal WM, headless) cannot
use the vault; that is what the fallback above is for.

### Vault errors are not "no key"

`CredentialVault::read` returns `Ok(None)` for "no entry" and `Err` for "could not reach the
vault". Collapsing the two turns a locked keychain into the pipeline's misleading "API key is
not configured", which sends the user to re-enter a key that is already there. The STT path
surfaces a distinct message and aborts; the LLM path logs a warning and skips polish, because
failing the dictation outright would throw away a transcript the user already spoke.

The same distinction reaches the UI. `get_credential_status` returns a four-state
`KeyPresence` per namespace - `saved` / `saved_unencrypted` / `missing` /
`unreadable` - not a boolean. Reporting an
unreadable vault as `missing` renders an empty field, which invites the user to retype the key
or press Remove, destroying a credential that was fine. The `unreadable` state shows
an explicit "Could not read your saved credential" message and
hides Remove, since offering to delete a key whose existence is unknown is not a safe option.

### Testing

`CredentialVault` is a trait so tests can substitute `MemoryVault`. **Tests must never touch
the real vault** - CI runs `cargo test` on three OSes, where a real vault either prompts for
authorization or fails on a headless runner. `MemoryVault::failing(msg)` exercises the
vault-rejects-the-write path.

The Linux build needs `libdbus-1-dev` (installed by both workflows in `.github/workflows/`);
the `linux-native-sync-persistent` feature uses kernel keyutils for the session and Secret
Service for persistence across reboots.

## SQLite (`<app_data_dir>/pipeup.db`)

Both stores use the same database file via `rusqlite` (bundled). Tables are created at startup with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` directly inside `HistoryStore::new` and `DictionaryStore::new`. The dictionary table also runs a forward `ALTER TABLE` ladder gated by `PRAGMA user_version` (see below).

### History (`HistoryStore`)

Columns currently created by Rust code:

- `id`, `created_at`, `app_name`, `app_type`, `raw_text`, `polished_text`, `language`, `duration_ms`.

#### Writes are opt-out

The pipeline writes a row only when `history_enabled` is true (`src-tauri/src/pipeline.rs`).
With it false, dictations are still transcribed, polished, and typed - nothing is recorded.
Rows already stored stay readable and searchable, **but retention still applies to them** -
turning saving off is not a way to freeze the archive. The Overview page shows saved provider settings; it does not present the loaded history
length as a lifetime total.

The flag is re-read at write time rather than taken from the recording-start config snapshot
(`preloaded_config`), so a user who opts out mid-dictation - possible in `toggle` hotkey mode
- is honored for that dictation. The read is cache-backed and effectively free.

The UI must consult the **persisted** config for this, not the Zustand `config`, which
carries unsaved Settings edits: `src/components/History/index.tsx` reads
`savedConfig ?? config`, so the "saving is off" notice can never claim the backend has
stopped recording before the change is actually saved.

#### Retention

Two rules:

1. **Count backstop** - `MAX_HISTORY_ENTRIES` is 5000, read from a constant inside
   `HistoryStore::add`, so it cannot be bypassed by a caller.
2. **Age limit** - `history_retention_days` (`0` = forever). Settings > Privacy offers
   Forever / 7 / 30 / 90. This one is *caller-supplied* as `add(entry, retention_days)`; a
   caller passing `0` skips it, which is what the tests do deliberately. Any new history
   writer must pass the real config value.

`HistoryStore::prune_older_than(days)` performs the age `DELETE` and is a no-op at `0`. It
runs at four points:

| Site | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `HistoryStore::add` | Trims during a long-running session. |
| After a dictation with saving **off** (`pipeline.rs`) | There is no insert, so `add`'s prune never fires; without this a session left running for weeks would honor the window only at launch. |
| App startup (`lib.rs` `setup`) | Catches a machine that was off past the window. Logs its row count even on success - it is the one destructive prune that runs unattended, so "my history is gone" has to be distinguishable from corruption. |
| `update_config` | A lowered retention applies on Save, not at next launch. Emits `history:changed` when it deleted anything, because `config:changed` only replaces each webview's config copy and the History pane would otherwise keep listing deleted rows. |

Prune failures are logged, never propagated - in `update_config` the config is already
persisted, so failing the save over a `DELETE` would be worse than a stale row.

Narrowing the window is confirmed in the UI before it is applied
(`settings.retentionConfirm`), matching the confirm already required by "Clear history"
for the same data. Widening, or switching to Forever, deletes nothing and is not confirmed.

**`history_retention_days` is clamped** to `MAX_RETENTION_DAYS` (~100 years) before it
reaches chrono, and the subtraction uses `checked_sub_signed`. chrono *panics* on
out-of-range durations, and the startup prune runs inside Tauri `setup` where a panic aborts
launch with no in-app recovery - so a hand-edited or corrupted `settings.json` must not be
able to reach it. Overflow yields "prune nothing", the safe direction.

**Deleted rows are scrubbed, not just unlinked.** `HistoryStore::new` sets
`PRAGMA secure_delete=ON` so freed pages are overwritten instead of returned to the freelist
readable, and `prune_older_than` / `clear` run `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` when they
removed anything so the text does not linger in the `-wal` sidecar. Note this scrubs content
but does not shrink the file - that would need a `VACUUM`, which is not worth blocking a
delete on.

**Timestamp invariant.** `created_at` is naive **local** time in the fixed-width format
`storage::HISTORY_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT` (`%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S`), shared by the pipeline's insert
and the prune cutoff. Fixed width means lexicographic ordering equals chronological
ordering, so pruning is a plain `WHERE created_at < ?` string comparison. Building the
cutoff in UTC instead would skew it by the machine's offset. Rows written in one timezone
and pruned in another are off by that difference - accepted, since the error is bounded by
hours against windows measured in days.

### Dictionary (`DictionaryStore`)

Schema version: `1` (tracked via `PRAGMA user_version`).

Columns:

- `id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT`
- `word TEXT NOT NULL`
- `pronunciation TEXT` (optional, used by manual entries)
- `source TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'manual'` - one of `manual` (added via the Dictionary page) or `user_edits` (auto-learned from a correction by the watcher in `src-tauri/src/correction/`).
- `observed_source TEXT` (nullable) - for `user_edits` rows, the STT-produced word the user replaced. Surfaced in the Settings UI tooltip and in the toast copy.
- `frequency_used INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` - initialized to `1` for `user_edits` inserts (the edit itself counts as the first use); `0` for manual inserts. Not yet bumped on subsequent dictation use - see the [learn-from-corrections handoff](../superpowers/notes/2026-05-14-learn-from-corrections-handoff.md) for the follow-up plan.
- `last_used TEXT` (nullable) - SQLite `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` (UTC), set at insert time for `user_edits`, `NULL` for manual.

Insert API has two intents:

- `DictionaryStore::add_manual(word, pronunciation)` - the Dictionary page "Add" form.
- `DictionaryStore::add_learned(word, observed_source)` - correction watcher.

Words are loaded before recording and injected into prompt building so custom terms are preserved (see `src-tauri/src/llm/prompt.rs`). `DictionaryStore::words()` returns only the `word` column, ignoring provenance.

Migration ladder: at `DictionaryStore::new`, the runtime ensures the legacy three-column table exists, reads `user_version`, and if `< 1` runs `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` for `source`, `observed_source`, `frequency_used`, `last_used`, then sets `PRAGMA user_version = 1`. Idempotent across repeated opens. Legacy rows migrate in place with `source = 'manual'`.

## `migrations/001_init.sql` is reference-only

`src-tauri/migrations/001_init.sql` declares richer schemas (`stt_provider`, `llm_provider`, `usage_count`, `idx_history_created`, `idx_dictionary_word`). Grep confirms the file is not loaded by any runtime code - the runtime always uses the narrower `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` blocks above. Treat the SQL file as a future-schema sketch, not as an executed migration.

If the runtime ever starts executing migrations, this section must be updated.

## Needs confirmation

- Whether the extra columns in `001_init.sql` (`stt_provider`, `llm_provider`, `usage_count`) are planned for a future migration runner, or should be removed from the file to avoid drift.
