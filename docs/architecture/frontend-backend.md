# Frontend And Backend Wiring

The frontend talks to Rust through Tauri commands and listens to Rust-emitted events. This page covers the wiring; pipeline state semantics are in [Pipeline](pipeline.md).

Evidence: `src/lib/tauri.ts`, `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`, `src/hooks/useTauriEvents.ts`, `src/App.tsx`.

## Tauri Commands

Rust commands are registered in the `tauri::generate_handler![...]` block at the bottom of `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`. TypeScript wrappers live in `src/lib/tauri.ts`.

**Rule:** every `#[tauri::command]` must be both registered in `generate_handler!` and called via either a wrapper in `src/lib/tauri.ts` or a direct `invoke()`. Adding one without the other is a common integration bug.

Current command groups (grep-verified against `generate_handler!`):

- Identity import: `identity_import_pending`, `import_legacy_identity`, `start_fresh_identity`, `restart_after_identity_choice`. These run before the normal stores and shortcuts are initialized. See [Identity migration](identity-migration.md).
- Pipeline: `start_recording`, `stop_recording`, `abort_recording`.
- Permissions: `check_accessibility_permission`, `request_accessibility_permission`, `check_microphone_permission`, `request_microphone_permission`. The two microphone commands are macOS-only in effect — on other platforms they short-circuit to `authorized` / `true`. Implementation goes through `src-tauri/src/audio/permission.rs`, which links a small ObjC shim (`src-tauri/src/audio/mic_permission.m`, compiled by `build.rs`) wrapping `AVCaptureDevice.authorizationStatus` and `requestAccess`.
- Config: `get_config`, `update_config`. Neither carries an API key — see Credentials below.
- Credentials: `get_credential_status`, `set_api_key` (an empty key deletes the entry). Keys are write-only from the webview: it can save one and ask whether one exists, but never read one back. Details in [Storage → Credentials](storage.md#credentials-os-credential-vault).
- Provider checks: `test_stt_connection`, `test_llm_connection`, `bench_stt_connection`, `bench_llm_connection`. Each takes `api_key: Option<String>` — `Some` probes a key the user has typed but not saved, `None` reads the vault.
- LLM metadata: `fetch_llm_models` (same optional-key convention, plus a `provider` naming the vault entry).
- History: `get_history`, `clear_history`.
- Dictionary: `get_dictionary`, `add_dictionary_entry`, `remove_dictionary_entry`.
- Hotkey: `update_hotkey`, `pause_hotkey`, `resume_hotkey`.
- Auto-start: `set_auto_start`.
- Corrections: `correction_undo`.

A generated command/signature reference would be a good fit for [`docs/generated/`](../generated/README.md); none exists yet.

## Events

Rust broadcasts shared events with `emit(...)` and targets navigation with `emit_to("main", ...)`. Calling `window.emit(...)` also broadcasts; the window receiver does not restrict its destination. The frontend subscribes through `useTauriEvents`. Cross-check with [Pipeline → Events](pipeline.md#events) when changing pipeline state.

Event names emitted by the backend:

- Pipeline: `pipeline:state`, `pipeline:error`, `pipeline:target_app`.
- Selected-text editing: `pipeline:editing_selection` (boolean) — whether the Accessibility preflight found a selection before the user spoke. `useTauriEvents` writes it to `editingSelection`, which puts an amber ring on the capsule pill for the rest of the run; the `idle` branch of the `pipeline:state` listener clears it. Emitted once per run from `start()` only, `false` included, so a dictation with nothing selected can't inherit the previous run's ring. The preflight is the only way into edit mode, so no ring reliably means "this will be inserted" — see [Pipeline → Selected-Text Capture](pipeline.md#selected-text-capture).
- Permissions: `permissions:mic_status` — emitted by Rust when the pipeline refuses to start because Microphone is denied; payload is the `MicAuthStatus` snake-case string (`not_determined` | `restricted` | `denied` | `authorized`). The frontend writes it straight into the Zustand store.
- Audio/STT/LLM streams: `audio:volume`, `stt:partial`, `stt:final`, `llm:chunk`.
- Corrections: `correction:suggest` (emitted to the capsule window only). `dictionary:changed` (emitted by `correction_undo` so any window that cares re-fetches via `get_dictionary`).
- Output: `output:no_target` (emitted to the capsule window only, no payload) — a paste did not land anywhere, so the dictation was left on the clipboard. `useTauriEvents` sets `clipboardTip` (and clears any soft pipeline error) so the capsule shows a "press ⌘V to paste" tip; it auto-dismisses and is cleared on the next `recording`. macOS only; never fired for terminals or chunked pastes. See [Pipeline → Paste-landing detection](pipeline.md#paste-landing-detection).
- Output: `output:edited` (emitted to the capsule window only, no payload) — a paste landed and replaced a selection. `useTauriEvents` sets `editedTip`, which shows "Edited — press ⌘Z to undo" for 3 s; it auto-dismisses, is dismissed by a click, and is cleared on the next `recording`. Ranked below `clipboardTip` and errors in `getCapsuleState`: those need the user to act, this only acknowledges something that already worked.
- Config: `config:changed` — emitted by `update_config` after persisting; payload is the full `AppConfig`. Every webview's `useTauriEvents` listens and `setConfig`s its local Zustand copy. Without this fan-out the capsule window keeps the stale config it loaded at mount, so settings like `capsule_auto_hide` would not take effect until the next launch.
- Tray: `tray:settings`, `tray:history`, `tray:about`, targeted to `main` only. Only the main frontend registers navigation listeners, including the capsule context menu's `navigate` event. The capsule keeps its `#capsule` hash across navigation and dev reloads while still receiving shared pipeline and config events.

`pipeline:error` is also used to surface permission-gate failures as machine-readable codes the frontend matches on exactly:

- `ACCESSIBILITY_REQUIRED` — pre-flight check in `pipeline::output_text` saw `AXIsProcessTrusted() == false`. Frontend flips `accessibilityTrusted` to `false`, surfaces the AccessibilityBanner, and `CapsuleError` renders a localized, sticky message.
- `MICROPHONE_DENIED` — pre-flight check in `pipeline::start` saw a `denied` / `restricted` mic status, refused to invoke cpal, and bailed before the recording state transition. Frontend flips `micAuthStatus` to `denied` and surfaces the MicDeniedBanner.

These codes are emitted bare, not wrapped in `"Output failed: …"`; see `output_error_message` in `src-tauri/src/pipeline.rs` for the helper that keeps the contract intact across the three pipeline emit sites.

Event payload contracts are not centrally documented yet; reading the emit sites is the source of truth.

## State

- App state and persisted config: `src/stores/appStore.ts` (Zustand).

## Two Windows, One Bundle

- `main` renders `MainApp`.
- `capsule` is loaded with `#capsule` and renders `CapsuleApp`.

`src/App.tsx` reads `window.location.hash` synchronously to avoid rendering the wrong app during startup.

The capsule is shown via `useCapsuleResize` in the order `setSize` → `setPosition` → `show`. `requestAnimationFrame` is intentionally avoided because WKWebView pauses rAF in hidden macOS windows (see `src/App.tsx` comment).

`useCapsuleResize` repositions the capsule on the monitor under the cursor every time the pipeline transitions from idle to active (and on first mount). It calls `cursorPosition()` then `monitorFromPoint(...)`, but converts the cursor to logical coords first: tao's `cursorPosition()` returns physical coordinates scaled by the **primary** monitor's factor, while `monitorFromPoint` checks against `CGDisplayBounds` which is logical, so on Retina + multi-monitor setups the lookup either fails or hits the wrong screen without the conversion.

### macOS Capsule Overlay Mechanics

To make the capsule render correctly across all the situations users hit on macOS — auto-hide, multi-monitor, other apps' fullscreen Spaces — four things have to line up. They are all fragile and easy to regress, so they are documented together here.

1. **Background throttling disabled.** The capsule window has `backgroundThrottling: "disabled"` in `tauri.conf.json`. Without it, when the user enables `capsule_auto_hide`, macOS WebKit suspends the capsule's WebContent process ~480 s after the window is hidden. A suspended WebContent stops processing IPC events, so the `pipeline:state` event emitted on the next hotkey press never reaches the JS listener that calls `win.show()` — the overlay silently never appears. Disabling background throttling sets WebKit's `inactiveSchedulingPolicy` to `None`, keeping the JS runtime alive while the window is hidden.
2. **Activation policy = Accessory.** `lib.rs` calls `set_activation_policy(ActivationPolicy::Accessory)` during setup. macOS excludes a `.regular` app's windows from other apps' fullscreen Spaces regardless of any window flag; only `.accessory` (status-bar) apps may join. The visible cost is that Pipeup has no Dock icon on macOS — the menu-bar tray is the only entry point. (Other overlay apps work around this by shipping a separate `LSUIElement = true` helper bundle just for the overlay window; we chose the single-bundle accessory route for simplicity.)
3. **NSPanel class swap + `NonactivatingPanel` style.** `configure_capsule_collection_behavior` in `lib.rs` swaps the capsule's `NSWindow` to `NSPanel` via `object_setClass` and ORs `NSWindowStyleMaskNonactivatingPanel` (1 << 7) into the style mask. macOS only renders an overlay inside a foreign fullscreen Space when the window is an `NSPanel` with this style; a plain `NSWindow` is hidden. Safe because `NSPanel` adds no extra ivars over `NSWindow`.
4. **Collection behavior + window level.** Same function ORs `NSWindowCollectionBehaviorFullScreenAuxiliary` (1 << 8) into the collection behavior (preserving `CanJoinAllSpaces`, which Tauri's `visibleOnAllWorkspaces: true` already set), and raises the level to `NSPopUpMenuWindowLevel` (101). Tauri's `alwaysOnTop` only sets `NSFloatingWindowLevel` (3), which sits below a fullscreen app's content; `NSPopUpMenuWindowLevel` is what status-item popovers use and reliably overlays fullscreen.

If any of these four are removed, the capsule will look fine on a single non-fullscreen display but silently misbehave in one of the harder cases.

## Caches For Hot Paths

`HotkeyModeCache` and `CloseToTrayCache` live in Rust because reading config from `tauri-plugin-store` is async and would block hotkey/window-close handlers. They are refreshed on every successful `update_config`.

## Needs confirmation

- Event payload contracts are not documented beyond the emit sites in code.
- A generated command + event reference would prevent the "wrapper exists but command isn't registered" class of bug; no generator exists yet.

## Preference and navigation consistency

`update_config` applies shortcut and auto-start changes before reporting a saved configuration. Preference writes and shortcut pause/resume share an async lock so restoration cannot overwrite a newer shortcut. The configuration cache changes only after a successful disk write. The tray language cache refreshes from saved `ui_language` and rebuilds the menu; webviews apply the language on `config:changed`.

`src/lib/router.ts` parses explicit Settings subroutes. `tray:about` navigates to `#/settings/about`; provider setup links navigate to Dictation or AI processing. `src/lib/hotkeyCapture.ts` keeps Save and Discard disabled until native shortcut restoration finishes.
