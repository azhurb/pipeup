# Feature Map

Reconciles public feature descriptions with what the repository actually does. Each entry lists the user-facing promise, the code that backs it, and any mismatch.

Related: [Providers](../architecture/providers.md) for STT/LLM IDs, [Pipeline](../architecture/pipeline.md) for runtime behavior, [Voice input](voice-input.md) for prompt rules.

Sources: `README.md`, current repo code. This fork is BYOK-only; the upstream cloud subscription, account/auth flow, and scene packs have been removed.

## Bring Your Own Providers

User-facing promise: users can configure their own STT and LLM providers with local API keys and switch providers from Settings.

Repo evidence:

- STT provider options live in `src/lib/constants.ts` and `src/stores/appStore.ts`.
- STT provider factory lives in `src-tauri/src/stt/mod.rs`.
- LLM provider options live in `src/lib/constants.ts` and `src/stores/appStore.ts`.
- LLM provider factory lives in `src-tauri/src/llm/mod.rs`.
- Connection tests and latency benchmarks live in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`.

Current repo STT provider labels (from `src/lib/constants.ts`):

- Deepgram Nova-3
- AssemblyAI
- Gemini 3.5 Transcribe
- GLM-ASR
- OpenAI Whisper
- Groq Whisper
- SiliconFlow

Current repo LLM provider labels:

- Zhipu
- DeepSeek
- SiliconFlow
- OpenAI
- Google Gemini
- Moonshot
- Qwen
- Groq
- Claude
- Ollama
- OpenRouter

Needs confirmation:

- The website mentions `GLM-4-Voice`; repo code uses `glm-asr` (model `glm-asr-2512`).
- The website mentions Yi and LM Studio; provider constants do not list them. LM Studio may work through a custom OpenAI-compatible base URL — inference, not verified.

## AI-Powered Text Polishing

User-facing promise: after transcription, the app can refine text by adding punctuation, removing filler words, improving formatting, preserving key terms, and optionally translating.

Repo evidence:

- `polish_enabled`, `translate_enabled`, and `target_lang` are part of `AppConfig`.
- LLM calls are orchestrated in `src-tauri/src/pipeline.rs`.
- Prompt construction lives in `src-tauri/src/llm/prompt.rs`.
- The LLM Settings pane exposes provider, model, base URL, AI polish, translation, and selected-text editing controls. The selected-text toggle is **disabled while AI Polish is off** — the LLM is what applies the spoken instruction, so the setting would otherwise be enableable into a silent no-op.

There are **two prompts**, selected by whether a selection was captured, not one prompt with an addon. Dictation polishing and instruction-driven editing want opposite things — the first forbids rephrasing and caps the output at the length of the input, the second exists to rephrase and has no meaningful length relationship to what was spoken — so appending the second set of rules to the first produced a prompt the model could not satisfy.

Dictation prompt behavior includes:

- punctuation cleanup, with the polished text required to end with terminal punctuation (`. ? !` or the language equivalent)
- minimal-edit polishing: small grammar fixes only, no rephrasing, restructuring, or word reordering — the user should still recognize their dictated sentences
- filler-word removal
- list and paragraph formatting
- dictionary term preservation
- translation to configured target language
- per-app-type tone addons (email, chat, document)
- prompt-injection resistance for the transcript

Selected-text prompt behavior includes:

- the spoken instruction sets the scope: the replacement may be far shorter or far longer than either input
- nothing outside the selection is touched, and the surrounding form (Markdown, list structure, code fences) is preserved
- a plain-dictation fallback: when the transcript isn't plausibly an instruction, it lightly polishes the dictation rather than forcing it onto the selection
- dictionary terms, language hints, and translation still apply
- the per-app-type tone addons are deliberately **skipped** — the register of an edit is set by the selected text and the instruction, and an "this is an email, be formal" nudge would formalize a passage the user only asked to spell-check
- prompt-injection resistance for both the selection and the transcript

A single trailing space is appended to an **inserted** dictation (see [Pipeline](../architecture/pipeline.md)), so successive dictations don't glue together. Text that replaces a selection gets no trailing space: it has to occupy the selected range exactly.

Output is always delivered via the system clipboard plus a synthesized Cmd+V (Ctrl+V on Windows/Linux). The user's prior clipboard contents are snapshotted and restored after the paste lands. For terminal-hosted CLIs that don't handle bulk pastes well (Claude CLI, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI) the paste is split into smaller chunks with brief inter-chunk delays, which is what keeps a long dictation from arriving as a collapsed `[Pasted text #1 +12 lines]` placeholder instead of your words. The CLI is recognised by process, by window title, or — in a pure terminal — by a coding CLI simply running on the machine, which is what covers session daemons like Herdr, tmux and iTerm2's restored sessions. See [Pipeline → Output](../architecture/pipeline.md) for the constants and the full recognition order.

### Reasoning models

Polishing one dictated sentence is a formatting job, not a reasoning one. A model that deliberates about comma placement costs latency in front of a user waiting for their text, tokens against a BYOK quota, and — if the scratchpad exhausts `max_tokens` — the answer itself. Measured on Groq's `qwen/qwen3.6-27b` for the input "One, two, three": 262 completion tokens with reasoning on, 7 with it off.

Two layers keep it out.

**1. Ask the model not to reason** (`llm::openai::reasoning_params`). Per-model request fields, gated narrowly on model ID and base URL. There is no "send it everywhere and let the others ignore it" option: Groq answers an unknown field with `property 'x' is unsupported` and a 400, and `reasoning_effort: "none"` is valid for Qwen3 but rejected by GPT-OSS, which takes only `low`/`medium`/`high`.

| Model gate | Field sent | Verified |
|---|---|---|
| name contains `gemini` | `reasoning_effort: "none"` | probed |
| name contains `qwen3` **and** Groq base URL | `reasoning_effort: "none"` | probed |
| `deepseek-v4*` on DeepSeek | `thinking: {"type": "disabled"}` | vendor schema |
| `kimi-k2.5` / `kimi-k2.6` on Moonshot | `thinking: {"type": "disabled"}` | vendor schema |
| GLM 4.5 / 4.6 / 4.7 / 5.x | `thinking: {"type": "enabled"}`, `temperature: 1.0`, `top_p: 0.95` | existing behavior |

GLM is the one model family this app turns thinking *on* for: left off, the API populates `reasoning_content` and leaves `content` empty, so the polish came back blank. That gate covers 4.5 and later only — GLM-4 predates the `thinking` field, and the shipped Zhipu default `glm-4-flash-250414` has no thinking mode to configure.

**2. Strip whatever reasons anyway** (`llm::think`). When a provider is in "raw" reasoning mode the scratchpad arrives inside the ordinary `content` field wrapped in `<think>…</think>` — Groq's default for Qwen3, and the norm for DeepSeek-R1, GLM and local Ollama/OpenRouter reasoning models. This is the layer that has to hold for providers the table above has never heard of, and for a user who types any model name they like into Settings.

The strip runs on the **stream**, not on the finished string: chunks are forwarded to the frontend as they arrive, so filtering happens before they enter the frontend store. The compact capsule displays a processing animation rather than streamed text. The filter therefore holds back any trailing text that could still grow into a tag (`<thi` may be one chunk away from `<think>`) and releases it as ordinary text when it turns out not to be. A response that is nothing but an unterminated block — `max_tokens` spent mid-thought — is reported as a failure rather than an empty string, so a dictation falls back to pasting the raw transcript and a selection is left untouched.

Needs confirmation:

- The core polish prompt is compiled in Rust and not directly user-editable in Settings.

### Editing Selected Text By Voice

Off by default (`selected_text_enabled`). With it on, selecting text in any app and then dictating turns the dictation into an *instruction about that text*: say "fix the grammar" or "make this a bullet list" and the selection is replaced with the result. Dictate ordinary prose instead and it is inserted as usual — the prompt's fallback rule covers the case where the user had something selected incidentally.

User-facing behavior:

- **Mode indicator.** When the app knows *before the user speaks* that a selection was captured, the capsule pill takes an amber ring for the whole run. No size or layout change. Because the Accessibility read is the only way into edit mode, the ring is a complete signal: no ring means this dictation will be inserted as ordinary text.
- **Confirmation.** After a successful replacement the capsule shows "Edited — press ⌘Z to undo" for 3 s. Replacing a selection is the one output path that destroys something the user already had, so it gets an explicit receipt with the undo shortcut.
- **Failure is non-destructive.** If the LLM call fails, the selection is left untouched and the error is surfaced. The raw transcript is never pasted over selected text.
- **Requires AI Polish**, since the LLM is what applies the instruction. The Settings toggle is disabled with a hint when polish is off, and the pipeline enforces the same rule independently.
- **Password fields are never read.** The Accessibility path guards on `AXSecureTextField`.

Platform matrix:

| | Selection capture | Ring appears |
|---|---|---|
| macOS, Accessibility can read the field | Accessibility preflight, no keystroke | At record start |
| macOS, browser text input (Chrome, Safari) | Accessibility preflight, no keystroke | At record start |
| macOS, Monaco-based editor (VS Code, Cursor) | Not supported — the app publishes no focused element | No ring |
| Windows, Linux | Not supported — the toggle is disabled | No ring |
| Windows / Linux | Ctrl+C fallback | No ring — confirmation tip only |

Mechanism: [Pipeline → Selected-Text Capture](../architecture/pipeline.md#selected-text-capture).

## Language Support And Auto Detection

User-facing promise: users mark zero or more languages they expect to speak; the STT auto-detects, the polish prompt is biased toward the marked set, and dictation history shows the detected language per row.

Repo evidence:

- STT languages live in `AppConfig.stt_languages: Vec<String>` (empty = auto-detect).
- `src/lib/constants.ts` exposes 20 language options; the Settings UI renders them as multi-select chips (`src/components/Settings/SttPane.tsx`). Selecting zero languages is the canonical "auto" state — there is no `"multi"` sentinel anymore.
- A one-shot migration in `ConfigManager::load` (`src-tauri/src/storage/mod.rs::migrate_legacy_config`) converts the pre-existing single-value `stt_language` field on disk: `"multi"` and empty become `[]`; any other code becomes `[code]`. After migration the old field is removed.
- Wire mapping (see [Providers → Language hint mapping rule](../architecture/providers.md#language-hint-mapping-rule)): Whisper-compatible adapters pin a `language=` form field only when exactly one is selected; Deepgram pins via URL or falls back to its native `multi` mode; Gemini Transcribe is the only provider that puts the whole selection on the wire, as a region-tagged BCP-47 array.
- Detected language is captured from STT responses and threaded into the polish prompt + history + a `pipeline:timing.detected_language` event (see [Pipeline → Detected language threading](../architecture/pipeline.md#detected-language-threading)).
- `src-tauri/src/llm/prompt.rs` injects a one-line context clause when detected language is known and lists the user's configured set; both pass through a strict display-name map to avoid prompt injection from wire-supplied values.
- A rate-limited toast (`src/hooks/useDetectedLanguageNotifier.ts`) tells the user when the STT detected a language not in their set; cooldown is 10 s per language code.

Needs confirmation:

- Whether GLM-ASR and SiliconFlow report `language` under `response_format=verbose_json`. Both currently accept the field silently; the parser falls back to no badge if absent.

## Global Hotkey

User-facing promise: a global shortcut starts voice input from other desktop apps.

Repo evidence:

- Hotkey config lives in `AppConfig.hotkey` and `AppConfig.hotkey_mode`.
- Defaults are `Alt+/` on macOS and `Ctrl+/` elsewhere.
- `parse_hotkey()` and `build_shortcut_handler()` live in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`.
- Settings can pause/resume hotkey handling while capturing a new shortcut.

Current behavior:

- `hold` mode starts on key press and stops on key release.
- `toggle` mode starts and stops on repeated shortcut activation.

Needs confirmation:

- The website text emphasizes toggle behavior, while the repo default is hold mode.

## Custom Dictionary

User-facing promise: users can add specialized terms so output preserves exact spelling.

Repo evidence:

- Dictionary storage lives in `DictionaryStore`.
- Dictionary UI lives under `src/components/Settings/DictionaryPane.tsx`.
- Dictionary words are loaded before recording in `src-tauri/src/pipeline.rs`.
- Prompt construction injects sanitized dictionary terms in `src-tauri/src/llm/prompt.rs`.
- The same words reach the STT step as `SttConfig.custom_vocabulary`, and only `gemini-transcribe` sends them on (capped at the API's 1,000 terms). The API accepts the field, but paired live trials on 2026-08-27, on synthetic and real microphone audio alike, showed no difference in the transcript with and without it — see [`../plans/active/gemini-transcribe.md`](../plans/active/gemini-transcribe.md). For every other provider the dictionary influences the polish prompt only.

Needs confirmation:

- Pronunciation is stored in the dictionary schema/UI, but current prompt construction uses only words from `DictionaryStore::words()`.

### Learn From Corrections (macOS, experimental)

Off by default. When enabled (Settings → Dictionary → "Learn from corrections"), OpenTypeless watches the focused text field via macOS Accessibility for up to 60 s after each dictation. If the user replaces exactly one word inside the typed span with a proper-noun-shaped replacement (capitalized, camelCase, all-caps acronym, or alphanumeric brand), the new word is added to the dictionary optimistically and a 5 s Undo toast appears in the capsule overlay. The toast reads *Replaced "Vladislav" with "Vlad"* — showing both the STT-produced word and the user's correction. The watcher skips `AXSecureTextField` (password fields) and never logs field values.

"Edit done" is detected via a **boundary-anchored settle predicate** — the chars flanking the dictated region in the field must still match the original surrounding context before a candidate substitution is considered. This is more robust than a pure time-based debounce, which mis-fires when the user pauses mid-edit. When dictation lands in an empty field (no surrounding context to anchor against), the watcher falls back to time-based debounce. Implementation: `src-tauri/src/correction/{mod,boundary,diff,classify}.rs`; frontend toast in `src/components/Capsule/CorrectionToast.tsx`.

Auto-learned rows in Settings → Dictionary show a subtle Sparkles icon next to the word; hovering surfaces the STT-produced word the user replaced. See [Storage → Dictionary](../architecture/storage.md#dictionary-dictionarystore) for the underlying `source`/`observed_source` columns.

## macOS Permissions UX

User-facing promise: the app surfaces the macOS permissions it needs (Microphone, Accessibility) up front during onboarding, and recovers gracefully when a grant is missing or has been revoked.

Repo evidence:

- Onboarding inserts a `PermissionsStep` on macOS between the LLM and How-It-Works steps (six steps on macOS, five elsewhere) — `src/components/Onboarding/index.tsx` and `src/components/Onboarding/PermissionsStep.tsx`. The step shows current Microphone and Accessibility status and routes the Grant buttons to either `requestMicrophonePermission` / `requestAccessibilityPermission` (when not yet asked) or directly to System Settings (when already denied — the macOS dialog is one-shot per install).
- `src/App.tsx` runs both `checkMicrophonePermission` and `checkAccessibilityPermission` at startup on macOS, and auto-prompts microphone when the status is `not_determined` *and* onboarding has already been completed (so an existing user who upgrades to a build with the upfront prompt still sees the dialog at launch instead of mid-dictation). During onboarding the auto-prompt is suppressed — the `PermissionsStep`'s Grant button owns that moment.
- Main-window banners — `src/components/MainLayout/AccessibilityBanner.tsx` and `src/components/MainLayout/MicDeniedBanner.tsx` — appear on macOS whenever the corresponding store flag turns negative. Each banner has a Grant / Open Settings action and a dismiss button.
- The capsule itself becomes actionable on permission errors: `src/components/Capsule/CapsuleError.tsx` renders localized, sticky messages for `ACCESSIBILITY_REQUIRED` and `MICROPHONE_DENIED` (no 2.5 s auto-clear, unlike transient errors), and `src/components/Capsule/index.tsx` swaps the capsule click handler from "start recording" to "open the relevant System Settings pane" while a permission error is active.
- The pipeline refuses to start when Microphone is `denied` / `restricted` (`pipeline.rs::start`); paste similarly refuses when Accessibility is missing (`pipeline.rs::output_text`). Both emit machine-readable error codes — see [Pipeline → Events](../architecture/pipeline.md#events) and [Frontend ↔ Backend → Events](../architecture/frontend-backend.md#events).
- Window-show predicate at launch lives in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs::should_show_window_on_launch` and surfaces the main window whenever the user is still in onboarding (no STT key yet or `onboarding_completed` missing / false), so a flag drop or a partial-config state always lands the user on a visible flow rather than a tray-only launch.

Troubleshooting flows for the signature-mismatch and one-shot-dialog cases live in [`docs/references/troubleshooting.md`](../references/troubleshooting.md).

## Privacy And Local-First BYOK

User-facing promise: API keys stay local and provider requests go directly to the selected provider. There are no OpenTypeless servers in the loop.

Repo evidence:

- API keys are stored outside `settings.json` (`src-tauri/src/credentials.rs`) and are never returned to the webview: the OS credential store on Windows and Linux, an owner-only file on macOS (where the Keychain would prompt after every update without a paid Apple Developer ID). See [Storage → Credentials](../architecture/storage.md#credentials-os-credential-vault).
- Plaintext keys from older installs migrate into the vault on first launch, and are cleared from `settings.json` only once the vault write succeeds.
- All STT/LLM providers call external provider endpoints directly from Rust.
- There is no auth, subscription, telemetry, or auto-update code in the build.

### Optional History And Retention

User-facing promise: recording dictation history is a choice, and what is recorded does not
have to be kept forever.

Repo evidence:

- Settings → General → History has a `Save dictation history` toggle (`history_enabled`) and
  a `Keep history for` picker (`history_retention_days`: Forever / 7 / 30 / 90 days).
- With the toggle off, the pipeline skips the history insert entirely; dictations are still
  typed. Entries already stored stay listed and searchable, and the History page says so.
- Retention applies to stored entries whether or not saving is on, so turning saving off is
  not a way to freeze the archive; the History notice and the Settings hint both say this.
- Narrowing the retention window asks for confirmation before it deletes, matching
  "Clear All History".
- Rows removed by retention or "Clear all" are scrubbed from the database file, not just
  unlinked — see [Storage → Retention](../architecture/storage.md#retention).
- Both default to today's behavior (on, forever), so upgrading deletes nothing.

## Offline And Local Models

User-facing promise: local LLM use is supported through Ollama. With a local STT provider plus a local LLM, the app can run fully offline.

Repo evidence:

- Ollama is listed as an LLM provider with `http://localhost:11434/v1`.

Needs confirmation:

- The current repo does not expose a clearly named local STT provider. Local Whisper support may depend on OpenAI-compatible endpoints or external setup not documented here.

## Desktop appearance

Pipeup uses warm neutral surfaces with a vermilion accent in light and dark themes, flat controls, and a single primary sidebar. Settings panes use a wrapping row of navigation buttons rather than a second sidebar. The compact capsule and preserved recovery states are described in [Voice input](voice-input.md#recording-feedback). Brand assets, compatibility identifiers, and regeneration commands live in [Appearance](appearance.md).
