# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Fork

Pipeup originated as a fork of [Tover0314/opentypeless](https://github.com/tover0314-w/opentypeless). The entry for `0.1.0` describes the upstream baseline; `0.2.0` is the fork's first release, marking the BYOK-only direction and the changes listed below.

## [0.9.5] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- **Gemini 3.5 Transcribe Live, a streaming speech provider.** Gemini transcribes while you speak, so the final transcript arrives about half a second after you release the hotkey instead of three to four seconds with batch. It uses your saved Gemini key.

### Changed

- **Removed the batch "Gemini 3.5 Transcribe" option; Gemini 3.5 Transcribe Live is now the only Gemini speech provider.** If you had batch selected, you are moved to Live automatically and your saved Gemini key keeps working.
- The recording capsule shows seven waveform bars again, as it did before the Pipeup redesign.

### Fixed

- Cancelling a dictation no longer uploads the recording to a batch speech provider.
- Long dictations into Claude Code no longer collapse into a `[Pasted text]` placeholder when the same terminal also runs Codex or Gemini, for example in other iTerm2 tabs or other Herdr panes. The paste is now split for Claude's stricter limit.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-09-26

### Changed

- Renamed the displayed product to Pipeup, with a warm light/dark interface, simplified app and tray icons, and a single primary sidebar with settings navigation across the top. The bundle identifier and existing local data remain unchanged. On macOS, quit and remove the old OpenTypeless app copy after installing Pipeup.
- Made the active capsule compact and text-free. Recording uses five audio-reactive bars; transcription and polishing use processing dots. Cancel appears on hover or keyboard focus, while recording limits and actionable recovery messages remain available.

- Reorganized the desktop into Overview, History, Dictionary, and focused Settings pages. Added appearance controls, consistent English/Chinese labels, and direct About navigation.
- Reworked onboarding around speech setup and optional AI processing, with a minimal capsule demonstration and visible save errors.
- Improved keyboard navigation, field labels, confirmation dialogs, and local-date History search. Search explicitly covers the latest 200 entries.
- Refreshed repository presentation, current screenshots, security documentation, and release migration guidance for Pipeup.

### Fixed

- Kept tray navigation in the main window so it cannot replace the capsule interface after a reload.
- Clarified that macOS Accessibility may retain the OpenTypeless name after upgrading to Pipeup.
- Made manual release builds check out the requested existing tag and use the same validated tag for versioning and release metadata.
- Keyboard shortcut edits now respect Save and Discard changes. Capture restoration and preference saving are serialized, and failed saves preserve the previous configuration.
- Translation controls explain their dependency on AI processing.

### Added
- **Gemini 3.5 Transcribe is available as a speech provider.** Pick it under Settings > Dictation and paste a Google AI Studio key. It transcribes a whole dictation in one request when you release the hotkey, the same way the Whisper-based providers do, and it has been checked end to end against the live API rather than only against the documentation. Pricing at the time of writing is roughly half a cent per minute of audio, with a free tier. Pressing **Test** costs nothing: it reads the model instead of transcribing, the same as the OpenAI Whisper probe, so it also tells you whether your key actually has access to the transcription model rather than only that the key is valid.

  **Two things it is sent that the other providers are not, and neither currently does anything.** Your dictionary words go along with the audio as recognition hints, and the provider is asked to clean up fillers and false starts before the text reaches the polish step. Google's API accepts both, and they are definitely the right parameters, since it rejects a misspelled one outright. They simply have no effect. Paired runs with and without them produce byte-identical transcripts, on synthetic speech and on a real microphone recording alike. The clearest case: dictating a string of digits comes back as "1 2 3 4 5" whether the cleanup mode is on or off, and turning spoken numbers into clean text is the one thing that mode most specifically promises.

  So the polish step stays on for this provider, and does the tidying itself. Nothing here is configurable and none of it costs you anything extra; if Google switches these on later, they start working with no change on our side.

  **It costs about three and a half seconds, whatever you said.** Measured over eleven real dictations: the request takes 3.0 to 4.1 seconds and barely moves with the length of the audio, so 2 seconds of speech costs 3.2 seconds and 15 seconds of speech costs 3.8. That is a fixed price per dictation rather than a rate, which makes it a poor fit for short bursts and unusually good for long ones. If you mostly dictate a sentence at a time, you will feel it.

  **Two smaller limits worth knowing.** Dictation history shows no detected language for this provider, because the response does not report one; the same is already true of AssemblyAI. And this is the batch model, not the real-time one, so there is no live partial text while you speak.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed
- **Editing selected text by voice was broken in every app, and the 0.8.0 notes blamed the wrong thing.** Reading your selection asked macOS for the *system-wide* focused element, and on macOS 26 that call refuses outright — `kAXErrorCannotComplete`, returned in 0 ms, for every application tried including TextEdit. It had presumably been failing for a long time without showing: until 0.8.0 the `Cmd+C` fallback quietly covered for it, so native apps appeared to work. Removing that fallback in 0.8.0 exposed the real breakage, and it was reported to you as a deliberate narrowing to "apps Accessibility can read". That description was wrong. The read now asks the frontmost application's own element, which answers in 31 to 53 ms and returns the selection.

  **Two things this brings back that 0.8.0 said were gone.** Text fields in a browser work — a Gmail draft in Chrome reads cleanly — and that covers Slack in a browser tab too. And the clipboard-restore check on the paste path went through the same broken call, so it had been failing closed and leaving every dictation on your clipboard; it now answers for real.

  **What genuinely does not work**, measured rather than assumed: Monaco-based editors (VS Code, Cursor) answer promptly to say they publish no focused element at all, because they gate accessibility behind screen-reader detection. And there is still no implementation off macOS, where the Settings toggle stays disabled. `AXManualAccessibility`, the documented way to switch Chromium's accessibility tree on, turned out to be neither supported by Chrome nor necessary.

  The `Cmd+C` fallback stays removed. Its own defect is real and unrelated: it read any clipboard change as a selection, and VS Code copies the whole current line when nothing is selected.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed
- **A long dictation into a coding CLI arrived as `[Pasted text #1 +12 lines]` instead of your words.** Claude Code replaces any paste over 800 characters, or carrying more than two line breaks, with a collapsed placeholder. The app already splits pastes into pieces that stay under both limits, and the limits were right — the problem was that the splitting never ran. It only triggered when the CLI could be proven to be a child process of the terminal window in front of you, and that stopped being true the moment anything else owns the session: iTerm2 hands its shells to a background `iTermServer` so they survive a restart, [Herdr](https://herdr.dev) is built entirely around a runtime that owns the agent's pane so it outlives detach and reboots, and `tmux` and `screen` do the same. In all of those the CLI is running, plainly visible in the process table, just not parented to the window you are typing into — so the app fell back to sending one large paste, which is exactly the case that collapses.

  Splitting now also runs when a coding CLI is running anywhere and the app in front of you is a terminal emulator. Where it cannot tell which CLI owns the window, it uses the strictest limit rather than guessing, because guessing wrong in the loose direction produces exactly the placeholder this fixes. Editors and IDEs are deliberately left out of that last rule: the likelier target there is the editor, and splitting a dictation across it would leave several undo steps behind one utterance.

  Herdr needs no separate support and has no setting: it is a runtime rather than an app, so the terminal you attach from is the paste target, and the change above is what covers it.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-08-15

### Fixed
- **A reasoning model typed its entire train of thought into your document.** Switching to a model that thinks before it answers — Groq's `qwen/qwen3.6-27b`, say, after the Llama 3.3 decommission notice — produced pages of the model arguing with itself about comma placement, followed at the very end by the one line you dictated. Nothing removed it: reasoning models emit their scratchpad in `<think>…</think>` tags inside the ordinary content field whenever the provider is in "raw" mode, which is Groq's default for Qwen3 and the norm for DeepSeek-R1, GLM and most local models. Two things now stop it. The app asks the model not to reason in the first place, per model and per provider — on `qwen/qwen3.6-27b` that took the same "One, two, three" from 262 completion tokens to 7, so it is a latency and quota fix as much as a correctness one. And whatever reasons anyway is stripped out, which is the layer that has to hold for a model name the app has never seen, since the model field in Settings is free text. The strip happens as the response streams rather than at the end, because the capsule draws chunks as they arrive — trimming afterwards would mean you watched the scratchpad appear and then vanish. A response that spends its whole token budget thinking and never reaches an answer is now reported as a failure, so your raw transcript is pasted instead of an empty string.
- **Dictating with something selected could rewrite text you never selected.** With "Edit selected text by voice" on, the app used to fall back to a `Cmd+C` whenever macOS Accessibility could not see your selection, and treated any change to the clipboard as proof you had selected something to edit. A copy keystroke does not mean that. VS Code and its forks — Cursor included — copy the **whole current line** when you press `Cmd+C` with nothing selected, and being Electron apps they were invisible to Accessibility, so they took the fallback on every single dictation. The copied line was then scored as your selection, which switched the request to the editing prompt: the one that permits rewriting, reordering and changing tone, rather than the dictation prompt's "minimal edits, do not rephrase". The result was an ordinary dictation coming back as a rewrite that kept your meaning but not your words, with nothing on screen to say a different mode had engaged — the amber ring is deliberately not shown for a selection found after you have already spoken. Editing now requires the Accessibility read that happens *before* you speak, and nothing else. The ring is therefore a complete signal for the first time: no ring means your dictation will be inserted, every time.

  **This narrows where the feature works, deliberately.** Voice-editing no longer reaches browser web content or Electron apps (Cursor, VS Code, Slack), and it is now macOS-only — the Settings toggle is disabled on Windows and Linux, which have no equivalent of the Accessibility read. Narrowing the old heuristic was tried on paper and rejected: clearing the clipboard first detects "the copy did nothing" but not "the app copied something else", which is the actual failure. Losing an edit is recoverable; silently rewriting text you did not select is not. Routes back to the lost targets — an explicit edit hotkey, reading the Edit ▸ Copy menu item's state, per-platform selection APIs — are written up in [`docs/plans/active/selected-text-in-ax-blind-apps.md`](docs/plans/active/selected-text-in-ax-blind-apps.md).
- **Zhipu's default model was sent a parameter its API does not define.** The request set `thinking: {"type": "enabled"}` for every model whose name began with `glm-`, but that field arrived with GLM-4.5; GLM-4 has no thinking mode to configure. The gate now covers the 4.5, 4.6, 4.7 and 5.x series only.

### Changed
- **Refreshed the default model for every LLM provider.** These seed a fresh provider pick and never rewrite a model you have already chosen, so a dead default strands new users specifically — and several were dead. `gemini-2.0-flash` was shut down on 2026-06-01, `deepseek-chat` was discontinued on 2026-07-24, and Groq decommissions `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` on 2026-08-16. Two more were on the way out: `moonshot-v1-8k` goes offline platform-wide on 2026-08-31, and Alibaba has frozen `qwen-turbo` and names `qwen-flash` as its replacement. `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4` was retired from Anthropic's own API in June and now routes only through resellers, at $3/$15 per million tokens to insert commas.

  New defaults, chosen for cheap, fast and — where there is a choice — no reasoning at all: Zhipu `glm-4-flash-250414`, DeepSeek `deepseek-v4-flash`, Gemini `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`, Moonshot `kimi-k2.5`, Qwen `qwen-flash`, Groq `openai/gpt-oss-120b`, Claude `anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5`. OpenAI, SiliconFlow, Ollama and OpenRouter keep theirs — each is still served, not deprecated, and genuinely non-reasoning, which beats a newer tier that reasons by default. Verified against provider documentation on 2026-08-15; the selection criteria are recorded next to the table in `src/lib/constants.ts` so the next refresh has a rule to follow rather than a guess.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed
- **A failing speech provider reported itself as a silent microphone.** When the STT call failed — a rate limit, a rejected key, a socket that dropped mid-recording — the pipeline emitted that error and then, on its way past the empty transcript, overwrote it with "No speech detected. Please try again." The frontend keeps only the last error it is told about, so every kind of transcription failure arrived looking like a hardware problem, which is the one thing it was not: the advice it gave you was to go and check a microphone that was working fine. The specific failure is now recorded as it happens and reported from that branch instead, and "No speech detected" is left for the case it describes — transcription succeeded and returned nothing. A stream that dies mid-recording, previously logged and otherwise swallowed, now reaches the same place.
- **Provider errors were shown to you as raw JSON.** The capsule echoed the provider's response body, and those bodies are JSON that says nothing useful first: Groq's rate-limit reply spends its opening 140 bytes on the model name, your organization ID and the service tier before mentioning a limit. The error pill is one truncated line about 29 characters wide, so what actually appeared on screen was "Could not edit the selected te…" — the prefix, and none of the reason. Provider failures are now worded as `<stage>: <reason>`, where the stage is Speech, Polish or Edit (which step failed matters when transcription and polish are different providers with separate quotas) and the reason comes from the same classifier the retry policy uses: `daily quota reached`, `rate limited`, `API key rejected`, `out of credit`, `model not found`, `request too large`, `provider unavailable`, `provider timed out`, `cannot reach provider`. A per-day budget is distinguished from a per-minute one because the advice differs — one clears while you wait, the other does not clear until tomorrow. The provider's full response still goes to the log; it no longer goes to the capsule, and your organization ID no longer appears on screen. Every message is unit-tested against the pill's width, since a message you cannot finish reading is the defect this replaces. See [`docs/references/troubleshooting.md`](docs/references/troubleshooting.md).
- An exhausted **daily** quota is no longer retried three times before being reported. Retry exists for failures that clear on a second attempt; a budget that resets tomorrow will still be spent 1.2 s from now, so the attempts only added a wait to the front of the same error. A per-minute limit — the kind the backoff was built for — is unchanged.
- **A busy app in the foreground could eat the start of your sentence, silently.** Recording deliberately begins before the rest of setup so no speech is lost while the app loads config and connects to the provider — the samples buffer in a channel holding about four seconds. But nothing empties that channel until the last step of setup, so a slow step in between spends the buffer, and once it is full every further chunk was thrown away without a word in the log. The macOS Accessibility read that looks for your selection was the realistic way to hit this: it is a blocking system call that was made directly on the async runtime with no time limit, so an unresponsive foreground app stalled everything behind it. That read now runs off the runtime, gives up after 500 ms, and has each of its system messages capped at 400 ms; losing it costs only the amber ring, because the clipboard fallback still runs. And dropped audio is now counted and reported when recording stops, with the amount of speech lost — previously a truncated transcript was indistinguishable from not having spoken, which is precisely what made the error above so hard to place.

**What was verified, and what wasn't.** The error wording was confirmed against a live failure: with the Groq daily token budget genuinely spent, the capsule showed "Polish: daily quota reached" and the call returned in 49 ms with no retry backoff, while the full provider response — organization ID and all — stayed in the log where it belongs. The two reliability fixes were not reproduced: no app was made to hang on Accessibility to watch the 500 ms timeout fire, and the audio channel was not overflowed to see the dropped-chunk warning. Both are reasoned from the code and verified only in that a normal dictation still works. If either is wrong, it is wrong in the direction of a log line that never appears, which is where things already stood.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added
- **Editing selected text by voice now tells you what it's doing.** The feature previously ran completely silently: nothing indicated that a selection had been picked up, nothing distinguished "inserted your dictation" from "rewrote your paragraph", and the only way to find out which had happened was to look at the document. Three changes. On macOS the app now reads your selection through Accessibility *at the moment recording starts* instead of copying it after you let go, so the capsule takes an amber ring while you are still speaking — and where Accessibility can read the field, the Cmd+C is skipped entirely, along with the modifier-release delay and clipboard round-trip it needed. Where Accessibility can't see the selection — browser web content, Electron apps, and every non-macOS platform — the clipboard capture still runs, so the feature works, but there is no ring: the selection is only readable after you let go of the hotkey, and a warning that arrives once you have finished speaking is not a warning. Those targets get the confirmation tip instead. The fallback isn't going away, because "Accessibility returned nothing" and "you have nothing selected" are indistinguishable. After a successful edit the capsule shows "Edited — press ⌘Z to undo" for three seconds: replacing a selection is the one thing dictation does that destroys text you already had, so it gets a receipt rather than the silent checkmark an insertion gets. And the Settings toggle, renamed to "Edit selected text by voice" with a description of what actually happens, is now disabled while AI Polish is off instead of being enableable into a setting that does nothing.

### Fixed
- **"Selected Text Context" crashed the app, and would not have worked if it hadn't.** Turning the setting on and dictating killed the process outright: capturing your selection synthesised Cmd+C from a background thread, and the macOS key-synthesis path it used resolves a character to a key by calling into Text Services, which asserts that it is only ever called on the main thread and aborts the process when it isn't. The keystroke is now built ahead of time as a pair of Cmd+C events with a fixed, layout-independent key code and posted from the main thread, the same way the paste path has always worked. That also closes a second, quieter bug on the same line: the old path posted the Cmd modifier as its own separate event, so an app could receive the `c` without it and type a literal "c" over the text you had selected.
- **The instruction you spoke was fighting the rules the model was given.** The selected-text instructions were appended to the ordinary dictation prompt, which forbids rephrasing and states that the output must not be longer than the input. In this mode the input *is* the instruction, so "make this a bullet list" capped the rewrite at four words and "fix the grammar" forbade the very thing it asked for. Selected-text mode now gets its own prompt built for editing rather than transcribing, with worked examples and an explicit rule for the case where what you said wasn't an instruction at all — if you dictate ordinary prose with something incidentally selected, it polishes your dictation instead of mangling the selection. The per-app tone nudges are deliberately skipped here: "this is an email, be formal" would formalise a passage you only asked to spell-check.
- **A failed edit used to overwrite your selection with the words you spoke.** If the LLM call failed mid-edit, the fallback pasted the raw transcript — so a selected paragraph was replaced by the literal text "fix the grammar" and the paragraph was gone. A failed edit now leaves the selection exactly as it was and reports the error. The plain-dictation fallback is unchanged; it is only the selection-replacing path that no longer has one, because there is nothing safe to fall back to.
- Text that replaces a selection no longer gains the trailing space that separates consecutive dictations. The paste has to occupy the selected range exactly, so an appended space nudged the following word out of place on every edit.
- Selected text is no longer captured when AI Polish is off. Nothing reads it in that case, so the Cmd+C only cost latency and churned your clipboard to produce something that was immediately discarded.

**Checked by hand before release**, because the crash was a main-thread assertion inside a system framework and no test can stand in for one: twenty-plus dictations across apps whose text Accessibility can read and apps where it cannot, producing no crash report; selections captured on both paths; the amber ring, the confirmation tip and the undo shortcut each confirmed in a running build.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added
- A transient provider failure no longer throws away the dictation you just spoke. A 429 or 5xx from the STT or LLM — the kind that succeeds on a second attempt — used to surface as an error after you had already talked for thirty seconds and waited. Three points now retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts, 400 ms doubling to 800 ms): the streaming STT WebSocket handshake, the Whisper-compatible file upload that produces the transcript, and the LLM polish request. Retries are silent — the capsule already shows a progress state, and a "retrying 2/3" badge would make a recovery you were never meant to notice look like a fault — so at worst a failing dictation takes 1.2 s longer to report the same error. A 10 s time budget keeps that promise: retries only stack while failures are cheap, so a provider that hangs for a minute still surfaces its error instead of being retried into a multi-minute wait. Retry deliberately stops where output becomes visible: mid-stream audio is never resent (that would reorder or duplicate it), and the LLM response is never re-requested once polished text has started streaming to the capsule. Bad keys, malformed requests and exhausted quotas still fail on the first attempt, since retrying them only delays the error you need to see. See [`docs/architecture/providers.md`](docs/architecture/providers.md#retry-policy).

### Changed
- **API keys have moved out of `settings.json`.** On Windows they go to Credential Manager and on Linux to the Secret Service. On macOS they go to an owner-only file (`0600`) rather than the Keychain: a Keychain item is pinned to the exact app binary unless the app is signed with a paid Apple Developer ID, which would mean a keychain-password prompt after every update — worse than the plaintext file this replaces. That changes the day the project has a Developer ID. They were previously stored as plain strings in a JSON file readable by anything running as you, which for an app whose whole position is BYOK and local-first was the widest remaining gap between what the README claimed and what the app did. Existing keys migrate on first launch; the plaintext is cleared from `settings.json` **only after the vault write is confirmed**, so a locked or unavailable vault leaves your key exactly where it was and retries next launch rather than destroying the only copy. Keys are now filed per provider, so switching STT provider and switching back remembers the earlier key instead of overwriting it. A key is also never handed back to the UI once saved: the Settings and onboarding fields show a "saved" placeholder over an empty input rather than the secret, the config object the frontend holds no longer contains one, and "Remove" clears the stored key on Save like any other setting. Testing a key still works before it is saved — the connection-test, benchmark, and model-list commands accept the key you are currently typing, which is what onboarding needs and what makes "paste a new key, hit Test" report on the new key rather than the old one. A vault that cannot be *read* now says so specifically, instead of reporting a missing key and sending you to Settings to re-enter one that is already there. See [`docs/architecture/storage.md`](docs/architecture/storage.md#credentials-os-credential-vault). **The migration wants one real upgrade run to confirm** — launch with an existing plaintext `settings.json`, check that dictation still works and that the key is gone from the file.

### Fixed
- **Streaming dictations could lose their last sentence.** When recording stopped, both streaming providers sent their finish signal and closed the socket in the same breath — so whatever the provider sent *in reply* was thrown away. That reply is where the text lives: Deepgram flushes the results it still holds when told to close, and AssemblyAI only emits the punctuated, formatted version of a turn once the turn ends, which is the only version the pipeline treats as final. A short dictation that was one turn could lose all of it. Closing now reads what the provider flushes before dropping the connection, bounded so it can't cost latency on every dictation: 150 ms of silence ends the wait, 600 ms caps it, and AssemblyAI's own "terminated" message ends it immediately. Both providers' message parsing is now pure and unit-tested. **The timing wants one real dictation per provider to confirm** — see [`docs/architecture/providers.md`](docs/architecture/providers.md#draining-the-close-of-a-streaming-session).
- **Selecting "Deepgram Nova-3" never used Deepgram.** The provider is offered in Settings and its connection test, benchmark and pre-warm paths all recognise it, but the STT factory had no match arm for `deepgram` — since the initial commit — so choosing it fell through to the GLM-ASR default and sent a GLM-ASR request authenticated with a Deepgram key, which fails on auth. The arm now exists. Wiring it up also surfaced a second bug in the provider it activates: an end-of-speech result was reported as a bare "speech ended" signal and its transcript thrown away, even though Deepgram puts the last words of an utterance on exactly that message — and nothing downstream noticed, because the pipeline ignores that signal entirely and finalizes when audio stops. For a short dictation this would have dropped the whole transcript. Deepgram's message parsing is now a pure, unit-tested function covering interim, finalized, end-of-speech, silent, metadata and error messages. Note that `DeepgramProvider` was unreachable for this entire period, so its behavior against the live API is unverified — the parsing is tested, the round trip is not.
- **Testing an OpenAI Whisper key charged you for it.** "Test connection" and the latency benchmark verified the key by uploading a 0.1 s silent clip to `/audio/transcriptions`, which OpenAI bills like any other transcription — so checking your own credentials in a BYOK app cost you money. Both now read `GET /v1/models/whisper-1` instead, which proves the key is accepted for free. Other Whisper-compatible providers still use the upload probe. Ported from upstream.
- Every HTTP call built its own `reqwest::Client` — twelve construction sites — discarding the connection pool and paying a fresh TLS handshake each time. There is now exactly one pooled client for the app, shared by the pipeline, both provider factories, and the connection-test and benchmark commands. The provider factories take it by value rather than as an `Option`, so a provider can no longer quietly opt out of the pool. This matters more now that calls retry: without reuse, each attempt would handshake again.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added
- Dictation history is now optional and can clean itself up. Settings → General → History adds a **Save dictation history** toggle and a **Keep history for** picker (Forever / 7 / 30 / 90 days). With the toggle off, dictations are still transcribed, polished, and typed — they are simply never written to the history table; entries already stored stay listed and searchable, and the History page says saving is off. The toggle is re-read at write time rather than taken from the recording-start snapshot, so opting out mid-dictation is honored. Retention applies to stored entries whether or not saving is on, and is pruned on insert, after a dictation when saving is off, once at startup, and immediately on Save — narrowing the window asks for confirmation first, since the deletion can't be undone. Deleted rows are scrubbed rather than just unlinked (`PRAGMA secure_delete`, plus a WAL checkpoint), so expired transcripts don't stay readable in the database file. Both settings default to the previous behavior — history on, kept forever — so upgrading changes nothing and deletes nothing. The 5000-row cap remains as a backstop below the age limit. See [`docs/architecture/storage.md`](docs/architecture/storage.md#retention).

### Fixed
- **"Clear All History" did nothing on macOS.** The button was gated on `window.confirm`, and WKWebView only displays a JS dialog when the host implements `WKUIDelegate`'s `runJavaScriptConfirmPanelWithMessage:` — which `wry` does not, for confirm, alert, or prompt. So the call returned falsy without showing anything and the handler took its early return every time: no dialog, no delete, no error. Confirmations now go through a new in-app `ConfirmDialog` component (Escape and backdrop dismiss, Cancel focused by default for destructive actions), and `no-restricted-properties` in `eslint.config.js` fails the build if `window.confirm`/`alert`/`prompt` reappear. The bug was macOS-only — webkit2gtk and WebView2 supply their own default dialogs — and had been present since the button was written.
- Leaving Settings with unsaved changes silently discarded them: the pane re-snapshotted the *edited* config as its baseline on every mount, so the "Unsaved changes" bar never came back and the edits were never sent to Rust. The baseline is now the config the backend actually has on disk, so the bar persists until you save or reset. This was most visible with the new history toggle, where the History page could claim saving was off while every dictation was still being recorded.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- Keep a dictation on the clipboard when it has nowhere to land, instead of silently losing it — with a "Copied — press ⌘V to paste" capsule tip where the no-target case can be detected. Previously, if the synthesized paste had no target (focus on a browser tab/title bar, the menu bar, the desktop, a non-editable control), the app still restored the user's previous clipboard over the dictation, so the text was gone. Now the previous clipboard is restored **only** when the paste is confidently confirmed to have landed in a focused text field (macOS Accessibility); in every other case the dictation is left on the clipboard so a manual ⌘V recovers it. Whether a paste landed is observed via delayed-clipboard rendering — the text is written to `NSPasteboard` lazily and the output path watches whether the receiving app reads it within a short window; when nothing reads it (a reliably-detected native no-target such as the menu bar or desktop) the capsule shows the manual-paste tip. Browsers read the clipboard on ⌘V even when discarding, so there the tip stays silent but the dictation is still never lost. A private sentinel pasteboard type detects clipboard managers so their pasteboard mirroring never causes a dictation to be restored over. Terminals and chunked CLI pastes are unaffected. macOS only. See [`docs/architecture/pipeline.md`](docs/architecture/pipeline.md#paste-landing-detection).

### Fixed
- First-few-words clipping at dictation start, especially noticeable on short utterances and worse under variable system load. `PipelineHandle::start()` used to run config load, foreground-app detection (three sequential `osascript "tell application System Events"` shell-outs, ~150–450 ms cold), STT WebSocket connect (~100–500 ms for streaming providers), and `cpal` stream open (~50–300 ms) *before* any audio sample was captured — so the first ~300 ms–1.2 s of speech after key-down was discarded. Two changes close the gap: `AudioCaptureHandle::start()` now opens the cpal stream first, and the audio mpsc channel (200 chunks × 20 ms ≈ 4 s) absorbs samples while the slow setup runs in the background; once STT connects, the forwarder task flushes the pre-buffer. macOS foreground-app detection is rewritten to use `NSWorkspace.frontmostApplication` (via the Objective-C runtime) plus an AX `AXFocusedWindow → AXTitle` read, replacing the three osascript spawns with a single in-process call (<5 ms). `recording_start` now stamps when capture really begins so the `pipeline:timing.recording_ms` metric stops under-reporting by the dead-window amount. See [`docs/plans/active/dictation-startup-latency.md`](docs/plans/active/dictation-startup-latency.md) for the timing breakdown and deferred follow-ups.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed
- Intermittent "only V typed instead of paste" bug on macOS, especially in browser text inputs and other Chromium/Electron surfaces. macOS Cmd+V is now synthesised by building the V key-down and key-up CGEvents directly via `core-graphics` and stamping `kCGEventFlagMaskCommand` on each event with `CGEventSetFlags`, rather than going through `enigo` 0.2.x which posted a separate Cmd `flagsChanged` event and relied on `CombinedSessionState` to propagate the modifier onto the V event. Under load that propagation raced the V event's creation and the receiving app saw a plain V keystroke, typing a literal "v" instead of pasting. Windows/Linux still use `enigo` Ctrl+V; the race was macOS-specific.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- Multi-language STT: Settings → Language is now a chip picker over a *set* of expected languages. Empty = auto-detect; one = pin at the wire; two-plus = auto-detect with the polish prompt biased toward your set. Detected language shows as a per-row badge in History and triggers a rate-limited toast when you dictate in a language you haven't configured. A one-shot load-time migration converts the previous `stt_language: "multi"` / `"en"` setting into the new array shape.
- Per-target paste chunking for terminal-hosted CLIs (Claude CLI, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI). When the foreground app is a recognised terminal emulator or IDE terminal panel (Terminal.app, iTerm2, Warp, Ghostty, Kitty, Alacritty, Hyper, WezTerm, VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, JetBrains family) and the window title matches a known CLI name, the paste is split into chunks with brief delays so the CLI's input buffer doesn't drop characters.
- Onboarding (macOS) now includes an explicit Permissions step that asks for Microphone and Accessibility up front, so users see the system prompts while they're paying attention instead of mid-dictation.
- Pre-flight macOS Accessibility check before paste. When the grant is missing the pipeline emits an `ACCESSIBILITY_REQUIRED` error code instead of silently dropping every synthesised keystroke; the main window shows an Accessibility banner with a Grant button, and the capsule surfaces a clear message.
- Pre-flight macOS Microphone check before recording. When the system status is `denied` / `restricted` the hotkey no longer starts a doomed pipeline run; a red banner in the main window points to System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone.
- New Tauri commands `check_microphone_permission` and `request_microphone_permission` (macOS, no-ops elsewhere) wrapping `AVCaptureDevice.authorizationStatus` / `requestAccess` via a small ObjC shim.
- Troubleshooting reference at `docs/references/troubleshooting.md` covering the macOS signature-mismatch case and the one-shot Microphone dialog.

### Changed
- Output is now exclusively clipboard-paste with the user's prior clipboard snapshotted and restored. Cmd+V (Ctrl+V on Windows/Linux) is synthesised directly via `CGEventPost`; the prior osascript / System Events round-trip is gone, so users only need to grant macOS **Accessibility** (a single grant covers both paste and the correction watcher) — no separate Automation permission is required.
- Foreground app detection on macOS now also captures the bundle identifier, used to drive per-target paste behavior.
- Settings broadcast: settings edits now reach every webview immediately via a `config:changed` event. The floating capsule reacts to changes like "Hide capsule when idle" without an app restart.
- Polish prompt is language-aware. It receives both the STT-detected language and the user's configured language set, so the polished output respects what you actually spoke.

### Fixed
- Paste-time crash on macOS Sequoia / Tahoe. `enigo`'s `CGEventSource::new()` internally calls `TSMGetInputSourceProperty`, which the OS asserts must be on the main thread; running it on a Tokio worker (introduced when paste moved to direct `CGEventPost` in PR #7) caused intermittent `SIGTRAP` aborts under input-source flux (right after granting Accessibility, switching apps, etc.). The Cmd+V synth now dispatches to Tauri's main thread via `AppHandle::run_on_main_thread`; the clipboard write stays on the worker thread (arboard is thread-safe).
- Hidden-window-during-onboarding. The "should I surface the main window at launch" predicate was hardcoded to `stt_api_key.is_empty()`, so users whose STT key was already configured but who needed to re-run onboarding (e.g. after a `tccutil`-driven permissions reset) landed on a tray-only launch with no visible UI. Predicate now also considers `onboarding_completed` and is extracted as `should_show_window_on_launch` with truth-table tests.
- Onboarding wiping existing API keys. `App.tsx` previously skipped `getConfig()` entirely when `onboarding_completed` was false, so the Zustand store stayed on `defaultConfig` (empty keys) while the user moved through the flow; the final-step save then wrote those empties over the still-on-disk values. Config is now loaded unconditionally so onboarding pre-populates from disk and re-running the flow is idempotent.
- "Learn From Corrections" toggle no longer shows on non-macOS where it would be a no-op.
- Output normalises CR (`\r`) and Unicode line separators to LF before paste, fixing odd line breaks in pasted multi-line text.
- Release builds for Linux and Windows now compile again — `build.rs` cfg-gates the macOS-only `cc::Build` call so non-Mac targets don't fail at compile time.

### Removed
- "Output Mode" setting in Settings → General and the associated macOS Accessibility permission card.
- Streaming-as-you-type output: LLM polish output now lands as a single paste once polish completes. The capsule still renders the live polish indicator from `llm:chunk` events.
- Single-string `stt_language` config field; replaced with `stt_languages: Vec<String>` (auto-migrated on first launch).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-10

First fork release. Cuts cloud / account / subscription / telemetry surfaces and ships substantive UX and reliability work on top of upstream `0.1.0`.

### Added
- Streaming keyboard output — LLM tokens are typed as they arrive instead of after the full response
- Live mic volume drives the capsule waveform bars during recording
- Indeterminate progress bar in the capsule replaces the "Transcribing…" placeholder
- macOS install steps in the README; signed macOS release builds via a stable self-signed certificate

### Changed
- BYOK-only build: cloud account, subscription, and telemetry surfaces removed; no auto-update
- Tightened LLM polish prompt; typed output ends with a trailing space
- Always start in the tray; the `start_minimized` setting was dropped
- Capsule trims post-recording stage chrome and stays at polishing width to avoid a mid-exit clip
- Capsule respects `capsule_auto_hide` on fresh launch and asserts hidden on first mount
- README translations removed; remaining Chinese test comments translated
- Discord references removed from documentation

### Fixed
- macOS capsule overlay now behaves correctly across hide, multi-monitor, and fullscreen Spaces
- macOS accessibility permission prompt no longer crashes (uses the real `kAXTrustedCheckOptionPrompt` constant)
