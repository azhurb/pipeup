//! Provider API keys, stored in the OS credential vault.
//!
//! Keys used to live in `settings.json` as plain strings, which for a BYOK app
//! is the widest gap between what the README claims and what the app does. They
//! now live in an owner-only file on macOS and in Windows Credential Manager or
//! Linux Secret Service where available. [`migrate_legacy_config_secrets`] moves
//! any plaintext left over from an older install on first launch.
//!
//! Secrets are keyed by `(namespace, provider)`, not by namespace alone, so
//! switching STT provider and switching back remembers the earlier key instead
//! of overwriting it.
//!
//! Everything here goes through the [`CredentialVault`] trait. That indirection
//! exists for one reason: `cargo test` runs on three OSes in CI, and a test that
//! touches the real vault either prompts for authorization or fails on a
//! headless runner. Tests use [`MemoryVault`]; normal startup selects the
//! platform store through [`default_store`].
